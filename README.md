# location_allocation_and_carbon_emission

In our thesis study, we present a location-allocation model and carbon emissions model to select the new best locations and minimize production and transportation costs, as well as reduce the environmental effects of the steel industry in Bangladesh. The models are solved using GAMS and LINGO software respectively, and the results can be used by decision-makers to efficiently manage the steel industry.
